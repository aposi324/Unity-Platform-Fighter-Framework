# Unity-Platform-Fighter-Framework
A work-in-progress platform fighter engine within the Unity engine.

# Purpose
This engine is being created for learning purposes. I am also creating a similar a similar platform fighter engine in GameMaker Studio 2.3 beta to compare the two engines.

Should this engine evolve into a robust enough state, any person may use it for any purpose.

# Current Status
The engine is still in early development with all features being experimental.

# Credits
Characters contained in the development builds belong to Gigab00ts, who intends on using them for his own platform fighter. They are used with permission.
